## About mountains

A **mountain is a large** [landform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landform) that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak.


## Definition


There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain.
